# Career Connecting Project [currently suspended]

This project implements a Recruitment Agency website. The platform offers valuable services to both Job Seekers and Employers, facilitating their interaction in the job market.

For Job Seekers, the website provides many features, including the ability to search for available job opportunities, submit job applications, and engage in self-promotion activities to increase attention for their profile.

Employers benefit from the platform by gaining access to a wide pool of talented individuals. They can post job advertisements, review submitted job applications, and easily find contact information for potential candidates.
