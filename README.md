# Career Connecting

This project is a Recruitment Agency website. The platform offers valuable services to both Job Seekers and Employers, facilitating their interaction in the job market.

For Job Seekers, the website provides many features, including the ability to search for available job opportunities, submit job applications, and engage in self-promotion activities to increase attention for their profile.

Employers benefit from the platform by gaining access to a wide pool of talented individuals. They can post job advertisements, review submitted job applications, and easily find contact information for potential candidates.

The purposes of this project are as follows:

1. Deliverable for a small Trainee Brokerage Company: This project was initiated based on a request from a friend in a Trainee Brokerage Company. It is important to note that due to ongoing development efforts and business requirements, the website is still a work in progress.

2. Deliverable for Database Lab Project: As part of a school assignment, the project's scope primarily focused on designing the database and establishing the necessary connections.
